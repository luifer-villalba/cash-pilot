#
# ⚠️  SECURITY: The .env.backup file contains database credentials.
#     It is already in .gitignore and should NEVER be committed to git.
#
# This file is used by:
#   - scripts/backup_production.sh
#   - scripts/restore_production.sh
#
# Note: scripts/restore_to_railway.sh does NOT use this file.
#       It accepts DATABASE_URL as a command-line parameter instead.
